                            A <u id="first"><b>null</b></u> was making fun of the <u id="second"><b>null</b></u> one day for being slow.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <u><b id="yes">null</b></u> replied the <u id="second"><b>null</b></u>. "but i get there <u><b id="speed">null</b></u> than you think. I'll run a race and prove it."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <u id="first"><b>null</b></u> was so much <u><b id="adjective">null</b></u> at the idea of running a race with the <u id="second"><b>null</b></u>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u><b id="third">null</b></u>,
                            who has consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,"
                            <u><b id="quote">null</b></u>".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <u id="first"><b>null</b></u> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <u id="second"><b>null</b></u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <u id="first"><b>null</b></u>. he went off the
                            course to practise
                            <u id="verb"><b>null</b></u> for <u><b id="number">null</b></u> hours untill the <u id="second"><b>null</b></u> should catch up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <u id="second"><b>null</b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <u id="first"><b>null</b></u> was <u id="verb"><b>null</b></u>. The <u id="first"><b>null</b></u> was
                            so caught up in <u id="verb"><b>null</b></u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u id="second"><b>null</b></u> was near the goal. The <u id="first"><b>null</b></u> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <u id="second"><b>null</b></u>                            in time.
